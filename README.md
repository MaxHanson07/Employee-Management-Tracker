  ### Usage
  Download necessary installations and run node.js in console or other form of terminal in order to make the App listen on your local port 3006. You should then be greeted with a main menu of sorts asking you what you want to do:

  Keep answering the questions as you please. Keep in mind that you will have to create at least one department before you can create a role, and at least one role before you can create an employee. This is because you need to assign a role to a department and an employee to a role when creating a role or employee respectively.

  The id number for both role and department can be found under option 2 on the main menu. These numbers are needed when assigning either an employee or role during creation.
